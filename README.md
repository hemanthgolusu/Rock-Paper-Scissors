# Rock Paper Scissors

This project is part of my learning journey in frontend development.  
As I learn and implement the core concepts of frontend development, I am building multiple small projects end-to-end, including development and deployment.  
This Rock Paper Scissors game is one such project.

## About the Project
A simple interactive Rock Paper Scissors game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
The user selects Rock, Paper, or Scissors, and the computer randomly makes a choice. The game then displays the result — win, lose, or draw — and updates the score dynamically.

- Structuring a complete frontend project from scratch
- Designing interactive UI with HTML and CSS
- Handling click events using JavaScript
- Implementing game logic and conditional flows
- Generating random choices for computer moves
- Updating the DOM dynamically for scores and messages
- Styling interactive elements and visual feedback
- Deployment using GitHub Pages

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5** – Page structure and layout
- **CSS3** – Styling, layout, hover effects
- **JavaScript** – DOM manipulation, event handling, game logic

- **GitHub Pages** – Web hosting and deployment

## Key Features
- Clickable rock, paper, and scissors options
- Random computer choice generation
- Real-time score updates
- Dynamic result messages with color feedback
- Interactive UI and responsive design

## Learning Goals
- Strengthen JavaScript fundamentals
- Practice DOM manipulation and event listeners
- Understand conditional logic (if/else)
- Build and deploy a complete frontend project
- Get comfortable with GitHub Pages deployment

This project is part of my continuous practice to become a frontend developer by building and deploying real projects.
